An EC2 Launch Template is a reusable configuration blueprint that defines how to launch an EC2 instance. Instead of manually specifying the same settings (like the AMI, instance type, and security group) every time you need a new server, you define them once in a template.

This is a critical best practice for automation and consistency. Launch templates are the foundation for Auto Scaling Groups, allowing the system to automatically launch new, identical instances that are pre-configured and ready to serve traffic. By using a template, you ensure every server in your fleet is a perfect clone, reducing configuration errors and simplifying management.
