**AWS Cost Explorer:** This is a visualization tool that lets you view and analyze your historical and current AWS costs and usage. After enabling it, you can create custom reports to understand exactly where your money is going, identify spending trends, and forecast future costs.

**AWS Budgets:** This tool allows you to set custom spending limits for your AWS account. You can create a budget for your total monthly cost, for a specific service, or for resources with a particular tag. When your spending or forecasted spending exceeds a threshold you define (e.g., 80% of your budget), AWS will automatically send you an alert, allowing you to take action before costs get out of control.
